## ðŸš€This is my portfolio, built with ReactJS and Astro

## Motivation:
- I wanted to use Astro because it is blazingly fast at rendering markdown files, which i use to display my hobby and project information pages.
- Furthermore, with Astro i can use partial hydration and choose when something should be rendered, significantly reducing the shipped JS bundle upon page load.

## Shoutout to some npm packages,frameworks and websites i used for certain 3d models: (That made this website much more fun to develop)
- Tailwindcss
- react-three-fiber
- react-three/drei
- framer-motion
- sketchfab for the 3d models, and the gltfjsx and gltf-pipeline CLIs.

## Shoutout to my friend @huangledo for some art work and design choices.
